This website is designed to be as simple as possible and to last as long as possible while still being easy to modify in the future. So I'm trying to use only strongly stable technologies.
Although I want to avoid over-engineering this website, I also want to make it _look_ pretty. So I went with [lit](https://lit.dev) and [vaaden router](https://github.com/vaadin/router) to build a simple SPA-style front-end. Lit uses [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) with a lightweight reactive system on top. I figure that if lit goes out of fashion then I can reuse the web components with minimal overhead. I am also of course using TypeScript for my own sanity.
On the backend I am using [fastify](https://fastify.dev) for the server, mainly because express.js is ancient and I want something efficient so I don't have to pay much to host the site :). I'm using a very simple style of server-side rendering with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org). This allows me to write my articles basically however I choose while still getting the SEO advantages. Mainly I am using markdown and $\LaTeX{}$.
