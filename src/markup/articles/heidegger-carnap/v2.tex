\title{What Must Be Left Unsaid, and Saying It Anyways: \\ Logic and Metaphysics
in the Early \nth{20} Century}
\author{Phoenix Ada Rose Mandala}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle

	Carnap's 1932 \enquote{Elimination of Metaphysics} \nocite{carnap1966} is
	typically criticized as a poor reading of Heidegger. However, recent works
	have come to reject this reading. Although Carnap's paper itself fails on several
	fronts, it is indicative of the overall character of his project, and there is
	good reason to suppose that Carnap would read Heidegger seriously. In fact, the
	two authors share many of the same predispositions and assumptions. In this
	paper, I wish to explore these undercurrents, and to expose the origin of the
	difference between these giants of \nth{20} century philosophy.

	First, I will go over the historical and political movements which fuel their
	projects. The philosophers' positions will then be discussed against the then-dominant
	Neokantian school and the influence of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. I will then
	discuss the matters on which they agree and find themselves in contrast. The
	discussion will proceed through an analysis of the author's conceptions of
	fundamental epistemology, metaethics, and their relation to language.

	% The petit-borgeousie; material analysis

	Carnap and Heidegger were young men in 1914, when the world went to war:. The horror
	of industrial warfare and the decline of Western religious practices scarred a
	generation, prompting a radical political split. The classic dilemma of is and
	ought had come to engross the age: What are we to do about the
	incommensurability of (empirical-scientific) facts and (theological-existential)
	meaning? In the midst of the great war, the sociologist Max Weber wrote the
	following.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\cite[139]{weber2014}}] \dots what is the meaning of science as a vocation,
		now after all these former illusions \dots have been dispelled? Tolstoy has given
		the simplest answer, with the words: \enquote{Science is meaningless because it gives %
		no answer to our question, the only question important for us: \enquote{%
		What shall we do and how shall we live?}}
		That science does not give an answer to this is indisputable. The only question
		that remains is the sense in which science gives \enquote{no} answer, and whether
		or not science might yet be of some use to the one who puts the question correctly.
	\end{displayquote}
	This essay aims to clarify why science gives no answer.

	For Carnap and his Vienna Circle, the limitations of science are themselves the
	limitations of knowledge. Anything which can be said about material things (including
	individuals and their societies) can be stated clearly, in scientific language.
	The rise of psychology and sociology as disciplines, with figures like Weber,
	Durkheim, James, and Wundt empiricizing questions typically reserved for
	philosophy, alongside theories of linguistic logic by Russell and Wittgenstein,
	provided further fuel for their attitude. Metaphysical pronouncements outside the
	scope of logical analysis -- about abstract essences or universal ethics -- were
	considered \enquote{nonsense.} This term is not to be taken as a complete
	dismissal, however; the scientific worldview is meant to \enquote{serve life},
	not the other way around. Ethics, and politics, is to proceed from empirical grounds,
	as a sociopsychological science. Of course, they were not without their bias.

	In \enquote{The Scientific Conception of the World,} \nocite{hahn1973} they
	explicitly link their worldview with the socialist movements of the early \nth{20}
	century. They acknowledge a widespread disenchantment among Weberian lines, connected
	with the industrial mode of production. The European public \blockquote[{\cite[21f]{hahn1973}}]{with their socialist attitudes tend to lean towards a down-to-earth empricist view. In previous times \emph{materialism} was the expression of this view; meanwhile, however, modern empiricism has ... taken a strong shape in the \emph{scientific world-conception}}.

	While strict empiricism takes the priority for the positivists, Heidegger focuses
	on the lost sense of meaning. For him, the Western philosophical project is extremely
	fruitful, but fatally flawed. He aims to destruct the Western canon, clearing
	the space for a new world-conception which can provide us the ground on which
	to found a new kind of philosophy.

	If the sciences can provide us with the facts of their particular disciplines,
	and nothing further, Heidegger calls on us to examine the \enquote{nothing further}
	which by its nature sets the limitations of what can be known about beings.
	Similar to Kant, he is asking us to examine our intuitions in order to found our
	scientific knowledge. He takes on a phenomenological hermeneutic of our lived
	experience in order to found our intuitions. In so doing, he engages with the
	emotions and our relationships with other people, in addition to our relationships
	to mere objects. We relate to the world in myriad ways, and Heidegger believes
	these are worth investigating. The scientific worldview is, after all, one
	among many.

	It is well-known that Heidegger took the rectorate at Freiburg under Nazi
	reign, and delivered several lectures expounding on the \enquote{inner greatness}
	of the Nazi party. Throughout his life, he was taciturn about his involvements
	in the party. In a late interview, published only posthumously, Heidegger claims
	his involvement with the Nazi party was taken out of a sense of obligation, in
	order to keep the university intact, and to secure his position as rector.
	Regardless of the nature of his involvement with fascism, it is clear that Heidegger
	was against communism in any form, especially the technocratic version which
	the Vienna Circle would undoubtedly espouse. He argues that communism and \enquote{Americanism}
	(what I assume to be technocratic free-market capitalism) are forms of global
	technicity, that is, a movement away from viewing human beings in their full
	nature towards the total organization and technologization of human behavior
	in cybernetics. In his language, all beings, even Dasein itself, becomes
	uprooted from the earth and becomes ready-to-hand, no longer capable of being seen
	in its true essence. Although he does not make his political end-goal explicit,
	it is against this technicity, and towards a \textit{Volkish} ideal that Heidegger
	strives \autocite{heidegger1981}.

	Heidegger and Carnap are both seated within the Western philosophical
	tradition, and both are attempting to overcome it. Their methods differ quite
	dramatically, however, as do their end goals. Carnap wishes to clear away the cruft
	of the past few millennia in order to see rightly; fundamentally, he believed the
	Western canon was on the right track. Heidegger, however, wants to destruct
	the method and the worldview which evolved from Plato through Kant. Both do so
	in order to found a worldview which is capable of overcoming the existential conditions
	which underlie false metaphysical inquiry. These conditions are immediately
	tied up in both material analysis and practical philosophy, in questions concerning
	both empirical facts and lived meaning. In the next section we will take a
	look at how they each went about this destruction.

	%=========================================================================%
	\section{Husserl and Neokantianism}

	Heidegger and Carnap were both educated in the Neokantian tradition. In
	keeping with the post-Kantian idealists, the Neokantians rejected the Kantian distinction
	between the realms of pure sensibility and understanding. Over spatio-temporal
	intuition, they preferred a pure logical basis for the object of knowledge.
	\autocite[28]{friedman2000} The tradition was divided between several schools,
	most notably the Marburg school and the Southwest school. While there are many
	differences between these camps, the primary distinction I will focus on is their
	stance on the distinction between logic and values.

	Logic, being a discursive science aimed at proper thinking, was considered \emph{normative.}
	For Rickert, a key player of the Southwest school, this leads to the claim
	that logic belongs to the realm of transcendental value. Pure logic is then to
	be distinguished from psychological knowledge, which proceeds by empirical
	means. This leaves us with the gap between \emph{logic} as value, and \emph{psychology}
	as fact \autocite[34ff]{friedman2000}.

	Cassirer of the Marburg school rejected this distinction. Instead of cleaving the
	mind between transcendental psychology and pure logic, Cassirer claims that
	these gaps are \emph{moments} of cognition. They are not essential features
	which then are synthesized in to a single cognition, but a unitary relation which
	has been artificially analyzed into parts. Value and fact are analogous to the
	universal and the particular, but for Cassirer this is a difference in matter of
	\emph{viewpoint,} between understanding a thing in its \enquote{thinghood} (as
	it relates to universal/transcendental forms), and understanding a thing in
	its \enquote{context} (as a being among beings). This separation between
	viewpoints is \enquote{artificial,} only occurring after the initial unitary relation
	between mind and object. The originary perception finds these two aspects in
	unison \autocite[34ff]{friedman2000}.

	The parallels between Husserl and the Neokantian schools is fairly clear. Rickert
	writes positively of the \textit{Logical Investigation's}\nocite{husserl2005}
	polemic against psychologism, and there are clear parallels between the unitary
	relation of cognition in Cassirer and Husserl's unitary field of phenomenological
	consciousness (see \textit{Ideas} \S38)\nocite{husserl2012}. Akin to Rickert, Husserl
	ends up proposing transcendental phenomenological ideas as the basis of his ontology,
	but akin to Cassirer he proposes that value and fact are part of the same
	conscious process.

	The phenomenon was proposed by Husserl as a way of bridging the gap between
	the conscious being and the thing-in-itself. If the phenomenon is understood in
	Kant's way as the empirical intuition of a thing, then it could be said that
	Husserl's phenomenon is closer to the transcendental intuition itself, the conditions
	for the possibility of experience in the first place. Reality shows itself
	through these conditions and through phenomenal appearances. It is the work of
	phenomenology to transcend the appearances and move \enquote{to the things themselves.}

	Drawing inspiration from this tradition, but moving past it, there are a few shared
	concerns for Carnap and Heidegger: (1) Scientific thought is formal in nature,
	so it cannot capture values; (2) Language is key to thought; and, (3) The
	manner in which we use language corresponds directly to our practical aims.

	%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\section{Rational Construction}

	The scientific worldview lends itself to the notion of a unified science. It
	is Carnap's goal to place science on a unified ground, and in so doing to eliminate
	the confusions which traditional philosophy (\enquote{metaphysics}) has
	perpetuated. The goal of science is to \blockquote[{\citetitle[\S179]{carnap2003}}]{find and order the true statements about the objects of experience}.
	This can be split into two further goals: to create a constructional system corresponding
	to formal logic, and to investigate the relationships between objects of non-constructed
	experience. We then have two foundational aspects of construction theory:
	conventional stipulation of logical syntax and verification through empirical
	investigation.

	Carnap proceeds from unanalyzable phenomenological units which he calls basic
	experiences: these are whole-field conscious experiences which appear epistemically
	prior to the analysis of their constitutive parts. They are precisely the
	object of phenomenological analysis in Husserl's sense (\citetitle[\S64]{carnap2003}).\footnote{Carnap
	believed his system to be compatible with the three major epistemological
	movements: realism, idealism, and phenomenalism (\citetitle[\S177f]{carnap2003}).
	Nonetheless, he chose the Husserlian phenomena as his starting point.} However,
	basic experiences do not have any relation to a subject; the \enquote{for-me-ness}
	is analyzed into it after the fact. Similar to how we can only call integers \enquote{integers}
	in contradistinction to the real numbers once we have constructed them, we only
	understand our basic experiences as autopsychological in contrast with the later-constructed
	physical and heteropsychological objects. (\citetitle[{III.C \textit{passim.}}]{carnap2003}).

	Despite the inability to analyze the experiences themselves, he \enquote{quasi-analyzes}
	them by creating a formal allegory and examining the structures thereof. This amounts
	to a functionalization of objects, a switch from an ontological/material
	perspective to a structural/functional perspective. In this way he constructs the
	world through a purely formal analysis of basic experience. On this basis he
	claims to transform foundational epistemology from a speculative practice into
	a mathematically rigorous, logistical process.

	In the \textit{Aufbau,} Carnap aims to formulate a \enquote{one true language}
	from which to construct the world. In response to formal difficulties arising
	from the construction of the physical from the autopsychological, he is forced
	to reconsider his stance on logic, eventually realizing that there are many
	valid formal logics. Once we reach the \textit{Syntax,} this stipulatory
	nature is formalized into the principle of tolerance.
	%
	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[\S17]{carnap2000}}] \emph{In logic, there are no morals.}
		Everyone is at liberty to build up his own logic, i.e. his own form of
		language, as he wishes. All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to
		discuss it, he must state his methods clearly, and give syntactial rules instead
		of philosophical arguments.
	\end{displayquote}
	%
	Since logic is the ideal evaluative framework, but there are multiple valid
	logical systems, it is up to us to find the ideal logical system to relate to our
	practical aims, whatever they may be.

	Crucially, Carnap distinguishes between two modes of speech, the material and
	the formal. The material mode is defined by a casual transposition of complicated
	syntactical statements of the kind discussed in the \textit{Syntax} into
	ordinary speech. The move from discussion of syntax to discussion of material properties
	often leads to shorter and clearer explanations, but easily lends itself to
	confusion. While Carnap claims that this mode of speech is perfectly acceptable,
	and in fact unavoidable, he warns us that this translation leads us to speak of
	spurious universals - i.e., metaphysical essences. Additionally, some material
	sentences simply cannot be translated into formal syntax. Although these
	statements are useful for expressing ourselves, they cannot be subject to claims
	about truth and falsity, and so have no place in a scientific philosophy.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[\S81]{carnap2000}}] If a sentence of the material mode of speech
		is given \dots, then the translation into the formal mode of speech \dots
		must always be possible. \emph{Translatability into the formal mode of
		speech constitutes the touchstone for all philosophical sentences}, or more generally,
		for all sentences which do not belong to the language of any one of the
		empirical sciences. \dots Sentences which do not give even a slight indication
		to determine their translation are outside the realm of the language of science
		and therefore incapable of discussion, no matter what depths or heights of
		feeling they may stir.
	\end{displayquote}

	So Carnap has his linguistic prescription: if you wish to be intelligible, you
	must speak in a manner consistent with the formal mode of speech. This relates
	directly to his ethics. Carnap claims in a 1932 lecture that ethical claims are
	in essence prescriptive statements, specifically imperatives. These statements
	are manifestations of an attitude toward life. Imperatives are not
	translatable into formal language, but the material mode of speech allows us to
	slip up and propose spurious ethical essences. \enquote{Do not kill,} for example,
	is clearly an imperative, while \enquote{killing is evil} is an assertion
	about a universal property which does not admit of empirical evidence
	\autocite[\S1.4]{carnap1996}. Carnap's own prescription, then, must be an
	expression of an attitude toward life, and admits of no proper evidence other than
	a particular kind of faith in science.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[xvii.f]{carnap2003}}] Whence then our confidence that our call for
		clarity, for a science that is free from metaphysics, will be heard? It
		stems from the knowledge or, to put it somewhat more carefully, from the
		belief that these opposing powers belong to the past. \dots Our work is carried
		by the faith that this attitude will win the future.
	\end{displayquote}

	His inability to admit of value-statements leads him directly into the famous
	argument against positivism, that the verification principle itself is a prescription,
	and cannot be verified. Any justification for normative ethics must be made within
	the language of science, but the objects of its study are a matter of \emph{psychology}
	and not something which can be derived from universal principles of reason.
	Any ethical claim must take the shape of formal-logical arguments proceeding
	from psychological principles of emotion, ultimately amounting to an arbitrary
	(set?) of formal languages which capture the ethical feelings we experience as
	part of our basic experience. In all cases, logic comes first, and the emotions
	come second.

	It is precisely this attitude which spells out the dangers of metaphysics.
	Metaphysical speech has the appearance of scientific rationality, while in fact
	only prescribing an orientation toward the world. This can lead to an unearned
	sense of authority for the individual. Carnap's argument against metaphysics -
	and especially against Heidegger - consists in this: speculative metaphysics
	is inherently authoritarian by lack of verifiably. In contrast, a communist
	ethics undoubtedly places a large emphasis on the authority of the group and
	the sentiment of comradery which is essential for the scientific enterprise.

	In summary: (1) Science is logistic in nature, proceeding from basic
	experiences to the construction of the world, while value postulation is a matter
	of irrational prescription, an animal reaction to chance situation. (2) The material
	mode of speech is natural but insufficient, leading us into confusion. If one is
	to proceed scientifically, they must speak in a way which is translatable into
	the formal mode of speech. (3) Material language has potentially deleterious psychological
	effects. The formal mode of speech most clearly aligns itself with a
	communitarian ethic, and specifically, the communist politic, while the material
	mode of speech aligns itself most easily with authoritarianism, specifically, the
	fascist politic.

	%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\section{Beyond Logic}

	Heidegger, like Carnap, begins his analysis from phenomenological grounds. But
	his idea of a phenomenon is quite different. His system is very intricate, and
	we will only have the space to cover a small fraction of it here. We will
	focus only on what is necessary to contrast his understanding of scientific
	rationality from Carnap's.

	Heidegger's project is to understand the essence of Being in its most general
	form. Already Carnap would stop us, claiming that the entire project is based
	on a delusion: we are here beginning our investigation in the material mode of
	speech. Further, Heidegger's goal to disclose fundamental ontology is directly
	opposed to Carnap's functionalization of the object. Heidegger knows this, and
	in fact this is his point. In \textit{Being and Time},\footnote{References to
	Being and Time are to the original page numbers, prefixed with an H. in the
	cited edition.} Heidegger engages in the form of a traditional philosophical-scientific
	treatise, but later he will abandon this method in favor of a more poetic
	style, essentially agreeing with Carnap that the scientific form is inappropriate
	for \enquote{the task of thinking.} Nonetheless, let us continue outlining Heidegger's
	fundamental ontology by examining his phenomenological method.

	Though the term \enquote{phenomenology} implies a science through its suffix, the
	form of \textit{l\'ogos} Heidegger has in mind is quite different from both
	the traditional syllogistic logic and the new mathematical logistics. What Heidegger
	means by \textit{l\'ogos} is closer to Hegel's dialectical logic, though he attains
	his definition through an etymological analysis of the original Greek terms.
	\textit{L\'ogos} is the manner in which a discussion allows the object of discourse
	to be seen (in Aristotle, \textit{apopha\'inesthai}). In this way, truth (\textit{al\'ethia},
	lit. \enquote{not to escape notice}) becomes a manner of \enquote{disclosing}
	or \enquote{discovering} (\textit{pha\'inesthai}, lit. \enquote{letting-be-seen})
	the phenomenon, with falsity being a manner of \enquote{covering up} (\textit{pse\'udesthai})
	to hide the \enquote{true} nature of the being as the object of discourse. So
	in this way, \textit{l\'ogos} as logistics cannot be the locus of truth. \blockquote[{\citetitle[33]{heidegger2008b}}]
	{\textit{A\'isthesis}, %
	the sheer sensory perception of something, is \enquote{true} in the Greek sense, and indeed %
	more primordially than the \textit{l\'ogos} which we have been discussing}. \textit{A\'isthesis}
	cannot cover up, as it displays itself as itself (as \textit{noe\^in}); at worst
	it can be a kind of non-perceiving (\textit{agnoe\^in}). The object of \textit{a\'isthesis}
	is the \textit{\'idia} as, and for example, color is the object of sight.
	Though \textit{a\'isthesis} shows things as they are, covering-up occurs
	through synthesis, the showing of something as or through something else.
	\textit{A\'isthesis} does not occur through a faculty of cognition, but
	directly, thus avoiding the Kantian dilemma of the interconnectedness of our faculties.
	Rationality in the Kantian-scientific sense occurs only atop of apohpantic
	logos. (\citetitle[Int. II.A, B]{heidegger2008b})

	So, the task of phenomenology is to (literally) discover the (Platonic) ideas of
	aesthetic perception. In order to disclose the Being of beings as they are in
	themselves, we must go through the intermediary character: our \textit{own} Being.
	To be clear, phenomenology cannot proceed in the form of propositional assertions
	as in Carnap. This form of logic separates the essential character of Being
	from its onto-historical context. By analyzing it in the abstract, the essence
	\enquote{gets understood in an empty way} and \enquote{loses its indigenous character}
	(\citetitle[36]{heidegger2008b}). It is clear then that the \textit{manner} in
	which things appear to us is of deep importance to Heidegger. Indeed, he will
	characterize us as having been thrown into the world irrespective of our will,
	perceiving the being-there of the world through the always-already-there character
	of mood. In bad moods,
	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[134]{heidegger2008b}}] Being has become manifest as a burden.
		Why that should be, one does not \emph{know}. And Dasein cannot know anything
		of the sort because the possibilities of disclosure which belong to cognition
		reach far too short a way compared with the primordial disclosure belonging to
		moods, in which Dasein is brought before its Being as \enquote{there.}
	\end{displayquote}

	Heidegger's criticism of the scientific attitude can be most clearly seen in
	his criticism of Descartes (\citetitle[{I.3 B, espc. \P21}]{heidegger2008b}). Here
	he talks fairly explicitly about values. The critique of Descartes hinges on
	his conception of being-in-the-world, as opposed to beings present-at-hand. He
	claims that Descartes mischaracterizes the essential nature of beings as
	Nature, that is, as founded on \enquote{an entity within-the-world which is proximally present-at-hand}
	(\citetitle[95]{heidegger2008b}). As in the \enquote{Question Concerning Technology,}
	\nocite{heidegger2008c} Heidegger claims that Descartes has essentially made
	the world ready-to-hand, thus enclosing it and making all of Nature, including
	man, into \enquote{standing reserve.} This view is somewhat ironic considering
	Heidegger's perceived Nazi sympathies, though reading Heidegger as a clear-cut
	Nazi hardliner is naive. In \enquote{Only a God can Save Us,} Heidegger explicitly
	denies any ties with the Nazi party, considering himself an \enquote{unpolitical}
	person. In fact, he characterizes himself as \enquote{confronting the Nazi party}
	in his Nietzsche lectures, and as the subject of scrutiny under Nazi rule.
	Whether or not he was truly sympathetic to Nazi politics is a matter of debate,
	but in any case he is explicitly opposed to socialism as \enquote{a form of planetary technicity}
	\autocite[206]{heidegger1981}.

	Carnap actually would agree with Heidegger that Descartes' project is insufficient,
	but his critique would be quite different. Instead of offering an analysis of different
	\enquote{modes of being} as a criticism of the Cartesian worldview, he would offer
	the gestalt-theoretical experience as having nothing to do with an ego. This
	has to be constructed from the aspects of the experience; \textit{res extensa}
	is not the most fundamental

	--

	Heidegger prefers a holistic approach. The analytic of Dasein occurs piecemeal,
	but each piece influences and is influenced by the whole. Carnap prefers a
	constructivist approach, where the basic units of experience are assumed, and
	the rest is built from there.
