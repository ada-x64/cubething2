\title{What Must Be Left Unsaid, and Saying It Anyways: \\ Logic and Metaphysics
in the Early \nth{20} Century}
\author{Phoenix Ada Rose Mandala}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle

	Carnap's 1932 \enquote{Elimination of Metaphysics} \nocite{carnap1966} is
	typically criticized as a poor reading of Heidegger. However, recent works
	have come to reject this reading. Although Carnap's paper itself fails on several
	fronts, it is indicative of the overall character of his project, and there is
	good reason to suppose that Carnap would read Heidegger seriously. In fact, the
	two authors share many of the same predispositions and assumptions. In this
	paper, I wish to explore these undercurrents, and to expose the origin of the
	difference between these giants of \nth{20} century philosophy.

	First, I will go over the historical and political movements which fuel their
	projects. The philosophers' positions will then be discussed against the then-dominant
	Neokantian school and the influence of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. I will then
	discuss the matters on which they agree and find themselves in contrast. The
	discussion will proceed through an analysis of the authors' conceptions of fundamental
	epistemology, metaethics, and their relation to language.

	% The petit-borgeousie; material analysis

	Carnap and Heidegger were young men in 1914, when the world went to war. The horror
	of industrial warfare and the decline of Western religious practices scarred a
	generation, prompting a radical political split. The classic dilemma of is and
	ought had come to engross the age: What are we to do about the
	incommensurability of (empirical-scientific) facts and (theological-existential)
	meaning? In 1917, the sociologist Max Weber wrote the following.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\cite[139]{weber2014}}] \dots what is the meaning of science as a vocation,
		now after all these former illusions \dots have been dispelled? Tolstoy has given
		the simplest answer, with the words: \enquote{Science is meaningless because it gives %
		no answer to our question, the only question important for us: \enquote{%
		What shall we do and how shall we live?}}
		That science does not give an answer to this is indisputable. The only question
		that remains is the sense in which science gives \enquote{no} answer, and whether
		or not science might yet be of some use to the one who puts the question correctly.
	\end{displayquote}
	% This essay aims to clarify why science gives no answer.

	% rough
	For Carnap and his Vienna Circle, the limitations of science are themselves
	the limitations of knowledge. Anything which can be said about material things
	(including individuals and their societies) can be stated clearly, in
	scientific language. The rise of psychology and sociology as disciplines, with
	figures like Weber, Durkheim, James, and Wundt empiricizing questions typically
	reserved for philosophy, alongside theories of linguistic logic by Russell and
	Wittgenstein, provided further fuel for their attitude. Metaphysical
	pronouncements outside the scope of logical analysis -- about abstract essences
	or universal ethics -- were considered \enquote{nonsense.} This term is not to
	be taken as a complete dismissal, however; the scientific worldview is meant to
	\enquote{serve life}, not the other way around. Ethics, and politics, is to
	proceed from empirical grounds, as a sociopsychological science. Of course, they
	were not without their bias.

	In \enquote{The Scientific Conception of the World,} \nocite{hahn1973} they explicitly
	link their worldview with the socialist movements of the early \nth{20}
	century. They acknowledge a widespread disenchantment among Weberian lines,
	connected with the industrial mode of production. The European public \blockquote[{\cite[21f]{hahn1973}}]{with their socialist attitudes tend to lean towards a down-to-earth empricist view. In previous times \emph{materialism} was the expression of this view; meanwhile, however, modern empiricism has ... taken a strong shape in the \emph{scientific world-conception}}.
	Their solution to the disenchantment can be found in the hope they place in
	science and collectivist movements taking shape throughout the continent.

	While strict empiricism takes the priority for the positivists, Heidegger focuses
	on the lost sense of meaning. For him, the Western philosophical project is extremely
	fruitful, but fatally flawed. He aims to destruct the Western canon, clearing
	the space for a new world-conception which can provide us the ground on which
	to found a new kind of philosophy.

	If the sciences can provide us with the facts of their particular disciplines,
	and nothing further, Heidegger calls on us to examine the \enquote{nothing further}
	which by its nature sets the limitations of what can be known about beings.
	Similar to Kant, he is asking us to examine our intuitions in order to found our
	scientific knowledge. He takes on a phenomenological hermeneutic of our lived
	experience in order to found our intuitions. In so doing, he engages with the
	emotions and our relationships with other people, in addition to our relationships
	to mere objects. We relate to the world in myriad ways, and Heidegger believes
	these are worth investigating. The scientific worldview is, after all, one
	among many.

	It is well-known that Heidegger took the rectorate at Freiburg under Nazi
	reign, and delivered several lectures expounding on the \enquote{inner greatness}
	of the Nazi party. Throughout his life, he was taciturn about his involvements
	in the party. In a late interview with \textit{der Spiegel}, published only posthumously,
	Heidegger claims his involvement with the Nazi party was at least partially
	out of a sense of obligation, in order to keep the university intact, and to
	secure his position as rector. Regardless of the nature of his involvement with
	fascism, it is clear that Heidegger was against communism in any form, especially
	the technocratic version which the Vienna Circle would undoubtedly espouse. He
	argues that communism and \enquote{Americanism} (what I assume to be
	technocratic free-market capitalism) are forms of global technicity, that is, a
	movement away from viewing human beings in their full nature towards the total
	organization and technologization of human behavior in cybernetics. In his
	language, all beings, even Dasein itself, becomes uprooted from the earth and becomes
	ready-to-hand, no longer capable of being seen in its true essence. Although he
	does not make his political end-goal explicit, it is against this technicity, and
	towards a \textit{Volkish} ideal that Heidegger strives \autocites{heidegger1981,heidegger2008c}.

	Heidegger and Carnap are both seated within the Western philosophical tradition,
	and both are attempting to overcome it. Their methods differ quite dramatically,
	however, as do their end goals. Carnap wishes to clear away the cruft of the
	past few millennia in order to see rightly; fundamentally, he believed the
	Western canon was on the right track. Heidegger, however, wants to destruct the
	method and the worldview which evolved from Plato through Kant. Both do so in
	order to found a worldview which is capable of overcoming the existential
	conditions which underlie false metaphysical inquiry. These conditions are immediately
	tied up in both material analysis and practical philosophy, in questions
	concerning both empirical facts and lived meaning. In the next section we will
	take a look at how they each went about this destruction.

	%=========================================================================%
	\section{Kant and Husserl}

	% Heidegger and Carnap were both educated in the Neokantian tradition. In keeping
	% with the post-Kantian idealists, the Neokantians rejected Kant's distinction
	% between the realms of pure sensibility and understanding. Over spatio-temporal
	% intuition, they preferred a pure logical basis for the object of knowledge. \autocite[28]{friedman2000}
	% The tradition was divided between several schools, most notably the Marburg
	% school and the Southwest school. While there are many differences between these
	% camps, the primary distinction I will focus on is their stance on the
	% distinction between logic and values.

	% Logic, being a discursive science aimed at proper thinking, was considered
	% \emph{normative.} For Rickert, a key player of the Southwest school, this leads
	% to the claim that logic belongs to the realm of transcendental value. Pure
	% logic is then to be distinguished from psychological knowledge, which proceeds
	% by empirical means. This leaves us with the gap between \emph{logic} as value,
	% and \emph{psychology} as fact \autocite[34ff]{friedman2000}.

	% Cassirer of the Marburg school rejected this distinction. Instead of cleaving
	% the mind between transcendental psychology and pure logic, Cassirer claims that
	% these gaps are \emph{moments} of cognition. They are not essential features which
	% then are synthesized in to a single cognition, but a unitary relation which
	% has been artificially analyzed into parts. Value and fact are analogous to the
	% universal and the particular, but for Cassirer this is a difference in matter
	% of \emph{viewpoint,} between understanding a thing in its \enquote{thinghood}
	% (as it relates to universal/transcendental forms), and understanding a thing in
	% its \enquote{context} (as a being among beings). This separation between viewpoints
	% is \enquote{artificial,} only occurring after the initial unitary relation
	% between mind and object. The originary perception finds these two aspects in unison
	% \autocite[34ff]{friedman2000}.

	% The parallels between Husserl and the Neokantian schools is fairly clear.
	% Rickert writes positively of the \textit{Logical Investigation's}\nocite{husserl2005}
	% polemic against psychologism, and there are clear parallels between the
	% unitary relation of cognition in Cassirer and Husserl's unitary field of
	% phenomenological consciousness (see \textit{Ideas} \S38)\nocite{husserl2012}. Akin
	% to Rickert, Husserl ends up proposing transcendental phenomenological ideas as
	% the basis of his ontology, but akin to Cassirer he proposes that value and fact
	% are part of the same conscious process.

	% The phenomenon was proposed by Husserl as a way of bridging the gap between the
	% conscious being and the thing-in-itself. If the phenomenon is understood in
	% Kant's way as the empirical intuition of a thing, then it could be said that Husserl's
	% phenomenon is closer to the transcendental intuition itself, the conditions
	% for the possibility of experience in the first place. Reality shows itself through
	% these conditions and through phenomenal appearances. It is the work of

	% Since at least Aristotle, metaphysics has been the study of the first
	% principles that underlie the various sciences and their most generic objects. In
	% addition to the special sciences, there is logic, which studies the analogous structures
	% of each special science. And, above them all lies metaphysics, the science of
	% first principles as such. Importantly, these first principles are accessible
	% as objects of intelligible intuition. That is, although we cannot access them
	% through our senses, we have access to them through our capacity to reason.

	% Kant criticized the traditional metaphysical system for its inherent
	% contradictions. Humans only have access to external objects through our sensible
	% intuition (i.e. through our access to space and time), and to internal,
	% psychological facts through our intellectual intuition. These sensible objects
	% (phenomena) are representations of the underlying 'real' objects (noumena),
	% which are purely intellectual. Although the phenomena are merely representations
	% which occur to perceiving creatures like us, the fact of their being is
	% reliant on the structure of our cognitive faculties. If the grounds of science
	% lie in transcendental principles and causes, then what Kant wishes to say is
	% that metaphysics ought to concern itself only with the way objects appear to
	% us, and not as they are in themselves. To Kant, we do not have direct access to
	% the thing-in-itself, the noumena as such. By making this distinction, Kant
	% rescues the foundations of science while supposedly ridding it of its
	% inherently contradictory character (where possible). However, his motivation
	% for this is not just to save the sciences from falling into skepticism. His primary
	% goal is to \enquote{limit reason in order to make room for faith.} This faith
	% is the rational belief in God as the foundational basis of our capacity for
	% freedom.

	\autocite{stone2017} recognizes three core aspects of Kant's critique of
	traditional metaphysics: (1) Kant acknowledges that metaphysics correctly identifies
	the grounds of science in the transcendental causes and principles of reason.
	(2) He denies any knowledge of the suprasensible subject-matter of metaphysics
	(noumena). (3) His goal is to save practical philosophy by limiting our knowledge,
	to \enquote{limit reason in order to make room for faith.} But Kant's critiques
	left open two large concerns. First, the notion of noumena seems to be largely
	without basis. Why believe in a realm of suprasensible things-in-themselves if
	we are only given access to the phenomena which represent them? Second, the
	rational faculties are based on spatiotemporal sensory intuition, but there is
	concern about the primacy of these intuitions.

	In order to overcome the limitations of Kant's system, Husserl proposes to
	study link our perceptions and the noumena, thus grounding our faculties and overcoming
	representationalism at once. Husserl's claim is that phenomena do not exist as
	objects-in-themselves, independently of our own interpretation. Rather, phenomena
	are those objects whose whole existence is dependent on our postulation through
	an intentional (directed) interpretation of sense experience. This
	transcendental process reveals to us the \textit{Urregion} of pure consciousness,
	containing the necessary and absolute entities (phenomena as such) which
	ground our human faculties. But here Husserl has solved the problems of noumena
	and intuition by the creation of a realm of suprasensible entities! He has, in
	effect, reinstated metaphysics. \autocite[4f]{stone2017}

	What about practical philosophy? For Husserl, ethics would appear as an
	objective science the same as any other. What is objectively good is what must
	necessarily appear good. Analogously to the postulation of sensory phenomena, evaluative
	phenomena are found in the \textit{Urregion} of consciousness insofar as they
	are postulated on top of volitional or emotional data. Ethics, then, takes on the
	shape of an objective science \autocite[5]{stone2017}.

	In overcoming metaphysics, Heidegger and Carnap are proceeding from, but overcoming,
	the phenomenological method which Husserl had laid out. Between them, there
	are a few shared concerns. Although they both wish to overcome metaphysics, I
	will focus on their stances on the nature of logic and value theory. In particular,
	I will show how for each author: (1) Scientific thought is formal in nature and
	cannot capture values; (2) Language is a key aspect of relating between the
	mind and the world; (3) The manner in which we use language corresponds directly
	to our practical, political, and ethical aims.

	%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\section{Rational Construction}

	For Carnap, the end of science is to \blockquote[{\citetitle[\S179]{carnap2003}}]{find and order the true statements about the objects of experience}.
	This can be split into two further goals: to create a constructional system corresponding
	to formal logic, and to investigate the relationships between objects of non-constructed
	experience. We then have two foundational aspects of construction theory:
	conventional stipulation of logical syntax and verification through empirical
	investigation.

	Carnap proceeds from unanalyzable phenomenological units which he calls basic
	experiences: these are whole-field conscious experiences which appear epistemically
	prior to the analysis of their constitutive parts. They are precisely the
	object of phenomenological analysis in Husserl's sense (\citetitle[\S64]{carnap2003}).\footnote{Carnap
	believed his system to be compatible with the three major epistemological
	movements: realism, idealism, and phenomenalism (\citetitle[\S177f]{carnap2003}).
	Nonetheless, he chose the Husserlian phenomena as his starting point.} However,
	basic experiences do not have any relation to a subject; the \enquote{for-me-ness}
	is analyzed into it after the fact. Similar to how we can only call integers \enquote{integers}
	in contradistinction to the real numbers once we have constructed them, we only
	understand our basic experiences as autopsychological in contrast with the later-constructed
	physical and heteropsychological objects. (\citetitle[{III.C \textit{passim.}}]{carnap2003}).

	Despite the inability to analyze the experiences themselves, he \enquote{quasi-analyzes}
	them by creating a formal allegory and examining the structures thereof. This amounts
	to a functionalization of objects, a switch from an ontological/material
	perspective to a structural/functional perspective. In this way he constructs the
	world through a purely formal analysis of basic experience. On this basis he
	claims to transform foundational epistemology from a speculative practice into
	a mathematically rigorous, logistical process.

	In the \textit{Aufbau,} Carnap aims to formulate a \enquote{one true language}
	from which to construct the world. In response to formal difficulties arising
	from the construction of the physical from the autopsychological, he is forced
	to reconsider his stance on logic, eventually realizing that there are many
	valid formal logics. Once we reach the \textit{Syntax,} this stipulatory
	nature is formalized into the principle of tolerance.
	%
	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[\S17]{carnap2000}}] \emph{In logic, there are no morals.}
		Everyone is at liberty to build up his own logic, i.e. his own form of
		language, as he wishes. All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to
		discuss it, he must state his methods clearly, and give syntactial rules instead
		of philosophical arguments.
	\end{displayquote}
	%
	Since logistics is the ideal evaluative framework, but there are multiple
	valid logistical systems, it is up to us to find the ideal system to relate to
	our practical aims, whatever they may be.

	Analogous to the ontological and functional perception of gestalt phenomena, Carnap
	distinguishes between two modes of speech, the material and the formal. The material
	mode is defined by a casual transposition of complicated syntactical statements
	of the kind discussed in the \textit{Syntax} into ordinary speech. The move from
	discussion of syntax to discussion of material properties often leads to shorter
	and clearer explanations, but easily lends itself to confusion. While Carnap claims
	that this mode of speech is perfectly acceptable, and in fact unavoidable, he warns
	us that this translation leads us to speak of spurious universals - i.e., metaphysical
	essences. Additionally, some material sentences simply cannot be translated into
	formal syntax. Although these statements are useful for expressing ourselves, they
	cannot be subject to claims about truth and falsity, and so have no place in a
	scientific philosophy.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[\S81]{carnap2000}}] If a sentence of the material mode of speech
		is given \dots, then the translation into the formal mode of speech \dots
		must always be possible. \emph{Translatability into the formal mode of
		speech constitutes the touchstone for all philosophical sentences}, or more generally,
		for all sentences which do not belong to the language of any one of the
		empirical sciences. \dots Sentences which do not give even a slight indication
		to determine their translation are outside the realm of the language of science
		and therefore incapable of discussion, no matter what depths or heights of
		feeling they may stir.
	\end{displayquote}

	So Carnap has his linguistic prescription: if you wish to be intelligible, you
	must speak in a manner consistent with the formal mode of speech. This relates
	directly to his ethics. Carnap claims in a 1932 lecture that ethical claims are
	in essence prescriptive statements, specifically imperatives. These statements
	are manifestations of an attitude toward life. Imperatives are not
	translatable into formal language, but the material mode of speech allows us to
	slip up and propose spurious ethical essences. \enquote{Do not kill,} for example,
	is clearly an imperative, while \enquote{killing is evil} is an assertion
	about a universal property which does not admit of empirical evidence
	\autocite[\S1.4]{carnap1996}. Carnap's own prescription, then, must be an
	expression of an attitude toward life, and admits of no proper evidence other than
	a particular kind of faith in science.

	\begin{displayquote}
		[{\citetitle[xvii.f]{carnap2003}}] Whence then our confidence that our call for
		clarity, for a science that is free from metaphysics, will be heard? It
		stems from the knowledge or, to put it somewhat more carefully, from the
		belief that these opposing powers belong to the past. \dots Our work is carried
		by the faith that this attitude will win the future.
	\end{displayquote}

	His inability to admit of value-statements leads him directly into the famous
	argument against positivism, that the verification principle itself is a prescription,
	and cannot be verified. Any justification for normative ethics must be made within
	the language of science, but the objects of its study are a matter of \emph{psychology}
	and not something which can be derived from universal principles of reason.
	Any ethical claim must take the shape of formal-logical arguments proceeding
	from psychological principles of emotion, ultimately amounting to an arbitrary
	(set?) of formal languages which capture the ethical feelings we experience as
	part of our basic experience. In all cases, logic comes first, and the emotions
	come second.

	It is precisely this attitude which spells out the dangers of metaphysics.
	Metaphysical speech has the appearance of scientific rationality, while in fact
	only prescribing an orientation toward the world. This can lead to an unearned
	sense of authority for the individual. Carnap's argument against metaphysics -
	and especially against Heidegger - consists in this: speculative metaphysics
	is inherently authoritarian by lack of verifiably. In contrast, a communist
	ethics undoubtedly places a large emphasis on the authority of the group and
	the sentiment of comradery which is essential for the scientific enterprise.

	In summary: (1) Science is logistic in nature, proceeding from basic
	experiences to the construction of the world, while value postulation is a matter
	of irrational prescription, an animal reaction to chance situation. (2) The material
	mode of speech is natural but insufficient, leading us into confusion. If one is
	to proceed scientifically, they must speak in a way which is translatable into
	the formal mode of speech. (3) Material language has potentially deleterious psychological
	effects. The formal mode of speech most clearly aligns itself with a
	communitarian ethic, and specifically, the communist politic, while the material
	mode of speech aligns itself most easily with authoritarianism, specifically, the
	fascist politic.

	%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\section{Beyond Logic}

	Heidegger, like Carnap, begins his analysis from phenomenological grounds. But
	his idea of a phenomenon is quite different. His system is very intricate, so we
	will only have the space to cover a small fraction of it here, mainly as it
	appears in \textit{Being and Time}.\footnote{References to Being and Time are
	to the original page numbers, prefixed with an H. in the cited edition.} We will
	focus only on what is necessary to contrast his understanding of scientific rationality
	from Carnap's.

	Heidegger's project is to study what it means for anything to be at all. This
	is the question of Being. For Heidegger, the question of Being is the proper
	aim of philosophy; it will take shape as a fundamental ontology. The goal of
	ontology is to set the \textit{a priori} foundations for the study of beings in
	general. In analogy with Carnap, Heidegger's approach is to analyze both the ontic,
	object-oriented sciences and the ontological, functional structure of consciousness
	in general. In doing so he and Carnap take on Husserl's goal of uniting the
	phenomena and the grounds of our rational faculties. However, in contrast to
	Carnap, Heidegger believes that in order to understand the object we must understand
	it \emph{as} an object; we cannot functionalize it and consider this to be a full
	explanation. We must consider the phenomena in its relation to our Being as a
	\emph{whole}, picking apart its various equiprimordial roots. In doing so the ambiguity
	of the material mode of speech will become essential. Simplicity and clarity
	are quite famously of no concern for Heidegger, showing us from the start a clear
	difference in the values which shape our thinkers' projects.

	In Heidegger's terminology, we must face up to the question of the Being of beings.
	We do this through an existential analysis of our own Being. We humans are exceptional
	in that our ontic existence is in fact ontological; that is, our Being is something
	we recognize, and which forms a problematic for us. This recognition makes us by
	nature capable of ontology. Because of this exceptional feature, it is through
	an analysis of \emph{our} Being, what Heidegger calls Dasein (lit. \enquote{being-there})
	that we can come to an understanding of Being in general. Further, this analytic
	must occur as Dasein exists \enquote{proximally and for the most part,} in its
	everydayness. In so doing we will not only found the sciences, but all other
	meaningful orientation toward the world (\citetitle[Int. I]{heidegger2008b}).

	The method of this analysis is phenomenology. Though the term \enquote{phenomenology}
	implies a scientific approach, the form of \textit{l\'ogos} Heidegger has in mind
	is quite different from both the traditional syllogistic logic and the new mathematical
	logistics. What Heidegger means by \textit{l\'ogos} is closer to Hegel's dialectical
	logic, though he attains his definition through an etymological analysis of
	the original Greek terms. \textit{L\'ogos} is the manner in which a discussion
	allows the object of discourse to be seen (in Aristotle, \textit{apopha\'inesthai}).
	In this way, truth (\textit{al\'ethia}, lit. \enquote{not to escape notice})
	becomes a manner of \enquote{disclosing} or \enquote{discovering} (\textit{pha\'inesthai},
	lit. \enquote{letting-be-seen}) the phenomenon, with falsity being a manner of
	\enquote{covering up} (\textit{pse\'udesthai}) to hide the \enquote{true}
	nature of the being as the object of discourse. So in this way, \textit{l\'ogos}
	as logistics cannot be the locus of truth. It is only in the phenomenon, or aesthetic
	experience, in which we find truth. \blockquote[{\citetitle[33]{heidegger2008b}}]
	{\textit{A\'isthesis}, %
	the sheer sensory perception of something, is \enquote{true} in the Greek sense, and indeed %
	more primordially than the \textit{l\'ogos} which we have been discussing}. \textit{A\'isthesis}
	cannot cover up, as it displays itself as itself (as \textit{noe\^in}, cf
	Husserl's \textit{noema}); at worst it can be a kind of non-perceiving (\textit{agnoe\^in}).
	The object of \textit{a\'isthesis} is the \textit{\'idia} as, and for example,
	color is the object of sight. Though \textit{a\'isthesis} shows things as they
	are, covering-up occurs through synthesis, the showing of something as or through
	something else. \textit{A\'isthesis} does not occur through a faculty of cognition,
	but directly, thus avoiding the Kantian dilemma of the interconnectedness of our
	faculties. Rationality in the Kantian-scientific sense occurs only atop of
	apohpantic logos. (\citetitle[Int. II.A, B]{heidegger2008b})

	So, the task of phenomenology is to (literally) discover the ideas (\textit{qua}
	principles) of aesthetic perception. This takes on the character of an existential
	hermeneutic which investigates Dasein as it appears to us in its everyday character.
	So in contrast to Carnap, the \enquote{for-me-ness} is an essential aspect of
	the phenomenon. It is clear then that the \textit{manner} in which things
	appear to us is of deep importance to Heidegger, and that the manner in which we
	express ourselves will be key to disclosing Being. Heidegger contends that our
	language has developed in accordance with the ontic perception. In order to overcome
	this, he requires us to rethink the grammar in which we speak. The manner in which
	we relate to, understand, and discuss the world are all aspects of what Heidegger
	calls our Being-in-the-world.

	% To be clear, phenomenology cannot proceed in the form of propositional assertions
	% as in Carnap. This form of logic separates the essential character of Being
	% from its onto-historical context. By analyzing it in the abstract, the essence
	% \enquote{gets understood in an empty way} and \enquote{loses its indigenous character}
	% (\citetitle[36]{heidegger2008b}). In Carnap's system, we analyze basic
	% experiences which takes its character as free from any onto-historical or
	% personal identity. Any \enquote{for-me-ness} is analyzed \emph{into} basic experiences.
	% For Heidegger, \enquote{for-me-ness} is essential to the very character of
	% Dasein's Being. It is clear then that the \textit{manner} in which things
	% appear to us is of deep importance to Heidegger, and that the manner in which we
	% express ourselves will be key to disclosing Being.

	Things in the world can show themselves to us in different ways. Two of the most
	important orientations are readiness-to-hand and presence-to-hand. Ready-to-hand
	entities are visible in their tool-use: they make themselves apparent to us in
	their useful capacities toward some goal or another. But when the tool breaks,
	we stop to consider the entity as it is in itself, as a material thing with
	constitutive parts, etc. This viewpoint, when the entity is considered primarily
	\emph{as} entity, is presence-at-hand.

	Heidegger characterizes us as thrown into the world against our wills, made to
	orient ourselves. We do so through our state-of-mind, manifested as mood. Our moods
	turn us \emph{away} from ourselves and toward the world, thus revealing beings
	to us in their factical nature. Entities only appear to us as present-at-hand
	or otherwise because we are already predisposed by our moods to find them in
	this way (\citetitle[I.5 \P29]{heidegger2008b}). Alongside mood, we find the
	equally basic relation of understanding. The world discloses itself to us, and
	thus we to ourselves, in our possibilities, that is, in all the potential utilities
	which they may hold. Potentiality is always future-oriented as something not
	yet actual, and never necessary. Understanding, then, as equiprimordial with
	state-of-mind, is a future-oriented disclosure of our potentiality. This
	aspect of understanding is called projection. Our moods, as a turning-away, close
	off certain possibilities for us, thus restricting our sight. The manner in which
	projection works out its restricted possibilities is called interpretation,
	and the manner in which we then see something \emph{as} something is called articulation.
	But this potential-utility of the ready-to-hand object manifests itself
	through a \emph{totality} of involvements. Every potentiality of the ready-to-hand
	is such an involvement, and the ready-to-hand is only understood as relating to
	the entire mesh of these potential involvements. Since only what is understood
	can be articulated, all predication always already has the structure of understanding.
	But, since all understanding relates entities to Dasein and in so doing wraps up
	their being within Dasein's world, any \emph{meaning} as such will be discovered
	alongside the Being of Dasein. Meaning, then, is a matter of the \emph{utility}
	of beings within-the-world. (\citetitle[\P31f]{heidegger2008b})

	So, Heidegger characterizes meaningful entities as just those entities which are
	understood in relation to our thrown projection, restricted in their
	possibilities (for utilization) by our state-of-mind. This interpretive structure
	is circular: we project meaningful possibility onto the ready-to-hand only
	because we already have a network of possibility structures in place by which
	to interpret them. Heidegger views this as a positive characteristic.
	\blockquote[{\cite[153]{heidegger2008b}}]{What is decisive is not to get out of the circle but to come into it in the right way. This circle of understanding is not an orbit in which any random kind of knowledge may move; it is the expression of the existential \emph{fore-structure} of Dasein itself. \dots In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of the most primordial kind of knowing. \dots The \enquote{circle} in understanding belongs to the structure of meaning, and the latter phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution of Dasein -- that is, in the understanding which interprets.}

	% TODO: Langauge, discourse, and assertion as a matter of being-there.

	% TODO: Fix this up. More about the scientific attitude, less about Nazism.

	Heidegger's criticism of the scientific attitude can be most clearly seen in his
	criticism of Descartes (\citetitle[{I.3 B, espc. \P21}]{heidegger2008b}). Here
	he talks fairly explicitly about values. The critique of Descartes hinges on his
	conception of being-in-the-world, as opposed to beings present-at-hand. He claims
	that Descartes mischaracterizes the essential nature of beings as Nature, that
	is, as founded on \enquote{an entity within-the-world which is proximally present-at-hand}
	(\citetitle[95]{heidegger2008b}). As in the \enquote{Question Concerning Technology,}
	\nocite{heidegger2008c} Heidegger claims that Descartes has essentially made the
	world ready-to-hand, thus enclosing it and making all of Nature, including man,
	into \enquote{standing reserve.} This view is somewhat ironic considering Heidegger's
	perceived Nazi sympathies, though reading Heidegger as a clear-cut Nazi
	hardliner is naive. In \enquote{Only a God can Save Us,} Heidegger explicitly
	denies any ties with the Nazi party, considering himself an \enquote{unpolitical}
	person. In fact, he characterizes himself as \enquote{confronting the Nazi party}
	in his Nietzsche lectures, and as the subject of scrutiny under Nazi rule. Whether
	or not he was truly sympathetic to Nazi politics is a matter of debate, but in
	any case he is explicitly opposed to socialism as \enquote{a form of planetary technicity}
	\autocite[206]{heidegger1981}.

	So, to conclude: (1) Science is formal in nature, relying on an orientation
	which prefers ontic analysis over ontological. Values arise from existential considerations,
	which can be explicated only in terms of an existential analysis of Dasein. (2)
	[Language is essential to thinking.] (3) The scientific worldview and its
	formal language lends itself to an ontic orientation which puts us at risk of
	dehumanization. Socialism and global capitalism, as technocratic regimes, reduce
	all Being into standing-reserve, potential for utilization toward an
	unexamined end.

	\section{Conclusion}

	The values which we hold can drastically impact the style and substance of our
	analyses. If we are prone to clarity and simplicity, a form of mathematical rigor
	can emerge. If we are prone to the ambiguous, a poetic form of speech more clearly
	fits our needs. Irrespective of how and why we value what we value, it is a key
	sociological finding that our social environments impact what we believe.
	Whether or not we intend them to, our values will find themselves leaking through
	to our philosophical discourse. If we are truly free to choose a logical
	system to suit our needs, then that choice will reflect pre-theoretical considerations.
	If we are to investigate what fuels those practical choices, it is essential to
	understand psychologically and existentially why we value what we do. All
	philosophy is, in some sense, autobiography.
