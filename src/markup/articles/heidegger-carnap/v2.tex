\title{What Must Be Left Unsaid, and Saying It Anyways: \\ Logic and Metaphysics
in the Early \nth{20} Century}
\author{Phoenix Ada Rose Mandala}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle

	Carnap's 1932 \enquote{Elimination of Metaphysics} \nocite{carnap1966} is
	typically criticized as a poor reading of Heidegger. However, recent works, such
	as \autocite{stone2017}, \autocite{priest2002a}, and \autocite{dambock2022}
	have come to reject this reading. Although Carnap's paper itself fails on several
	fronts, it is indicative of the overall character of his project, and there is
	good reason to suppose that Carnap would read Heidegger seriously. In fact, the
	two authors share many of the same predispositions and assumptions. In this
	paper, I wish to explore these undercurrents, and to expose the origin of the
	difference between these giants of \nth{20} century philosophy.

	First, I will go over the historical and political movements which fuel their
	projects. The philosophers' positions will then be discussed against the then-dominant
	Neokantian school and the influence of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. Finally,
	I will examine their famous one-sided exchange, and spell out the deeper-cutting
	analysis of Heidegger which Carnap really wished to express. All of this will
	be done through an analysis of the author's conceptions of fundamental
	epistemology, metaethics, and their relation to language.

	\section{Historical Background, Political Origins}

	In his 1917 lecture, \enquote{Science as a Vocation,} Max Weber laid out the limitations
	of science for guidance in our lives. To Weber, there are only three ways in which
	science can guide our thought. First, it provides a clear means of inquiry about
	things in the world through its empirical method. Second, it gives us a theory
	of causality which we can use to predict the results of our actions. Finally, it
	provides us a means of analyzing our basic attitudes with mathematical and logical
	rigor. Although the sciences can and should provide us a method of analyzing
	our beliefs, it cannot then tell us which things to value. It is entirely
	beyond the scope of the sciences to provide axioms for practical philosophy. Weber
	brings these limitations to the fore in order to dispel the student population's
	desire for an "academic prophet" who could quell the disenchantment brought on
	by the decline of the religious worldview. Industrial production and advances
	in empirical science had lead to a crisis of confidence in theology; without theological
	faith, there was no order by which to live. So, the question of the age is as
	above: What are we to do about the incommensurability of (empirical-scientific)
	facts and (theological-existential) meaning?

	\blockquote[{\cite[139]{weber2014}}]{Under these internal presuppositions, what is the meaning of science as a vocation, now after all these former illusions, the 'way to true being,' the 'way to true art,' the 'way to true nature,' the 'way to true God,' the 'way to true happiness,' have been dispelled? Tolstoy has given the simplest answer, with the words: 'Science is meaningless because it gives no answer to our question, the only question important for us: "What shall we do and how shall we live?" That science does not give an answer to this is indisputable. The only question that remains is the sense in which science gives 'no' answer, and whether or not science might yet be of some use to the one who puts the question correctly.}

	For Carnap and his Vienna Circle, the limitations of science are themselves the
	limitations of knowledge. Anything which can be said about material things (including
	individuals and their societies) can be stated clearly, in scientific language.
	The rise of psychology and sociology as disciplines, with figures like Weber,
	Durkheim, James, and Wundt empiricizing questions typically reserved for
	philosophy, alongside theories of linguistic logic by Russell and Wittgenstein,
	provided further fuel for their attitude. Metaphysical pronouncements outside the
	scope of logical analysis -- about abstract essences, ethics, or politics -- were
	considered \enquote{nonsense.} This term is not to be taken as a complete
	dismissal, however; the scientific worldview is meant to \enquote{serve life},
	not the other way around.

	In the \enquote{manifesto} of their group, \enquote{The Scientific Conception of the World,}
	\nocite{hahn1973} they explicitly link their worldview with the socialist
	movements of the early \nth{20} century. They acknowledge a widespread
	disenchantment among Weberian lines, connected with the industrial mode of production.
	The European public \blockquote[{\cite[pp. 21-22]{hahn1973}}]{with their socialist attitudes tend to lean towards a down-to-earth empricist view. In previous times \emph{materialism} was the expression of this view; meanwhile, however, modern empiricism has ... taken a strong shape in the \emph{scientific world-conception}}.

	The Vienna Circle could be seen as the culmination of the liberal
	Enlightenment project, the scientific worldview winding its way from Descartes
	to Kant to Marx. If the decisions we make in life are \enquote{irrational instincts}
	\autocite[{p. 4}]{carnap1929}, then we ought to guide those instincts through
	as rational a process as we can. The scientific worldview was designed to clear
	up pseudo-problems in philosophy in order to give us the space to think as clearly
	as we could about how to live our lives. Metaphysics was deemed a confusion, a
	misuse of language to describe in scientific terms what went beyond the scope of
	the sciences, and thus was irrational nonsense, poetic at best. The misuse of
	language would take center stage in the later Carnap's thought, and would drive
	much of the activity of the early \nth{20} century Analytic tradition. We will
	discuss language later; what matters now is the goal the Vienna Circle had in
	mind when pursuing this project. They sought to replace the dead God and his delusions,
	with a clear, scientific, collectivist attitude toward the world.

	\blockquote[{\citetitle[pp. xvii-xviii]{carnap2003}}]{We do not deceive ourselves about the fact that movements in metaphysical philosophy and religion which are critical of such an orientation have again become very influential of late. Whence then our confidence that our call for clarity, for a science that is free from metaphysics, will be heard? It stems from the knowledge or, to put it somewhat more carefully, from the belief that these opposing powers belong to the past.}

	Heidegger, meanwhile, aims to destruct this Cartesian project, clearing the
	space for a new world-conception which can provide us an ontological ground on
	which to found both the sciences and practical philosophy. Heidegger's critique
	of Descartes hinges on his conception of being-in-the-world, as opposed to
	beings present-at-hand. He claims that Descartes mischaracterizes the essential
	nature of beings as Nature, that is, as founded on \enquote{an entity within-the-world which is proximally present-at-hand}
	(\citetitle[H. 95]{heidegger2008b}). As in the \enquote{Question Concerning Technology,}
	\nocite{heidegger2008c} Heidegger claims that Descartes has essentially made
	the world ready-to-hand, thus enclosing it and making all of Nature, including
	man, into \enquote{standing reserve.} This view is somewhat ironic considering
	Heidegger's perceived Nazi sympathies, though reading Heidegger as a clear-cut
	Nazi hardliner is naive. In \enquote{Only a God can Save Us,} Heidegger explicitly
	denies any ties with the Nazi party, considering himself an \enquote{unpolitical}
	person. In fact, he characterizes himself as \enquote{confronting the Nazi party}
	in his Nietzsche lectures, and as the subject of scrutiny under Nazi rule.
	Whether or not he was truly sympathetic to Nazi politics is a matter of debate,
	but in any case he is explicitly opposed to socialism as \enquote{a form of planetary technicity}
	\autocite[p. 206]{heidegger1981}.

	If the sciences can provide us with the facts of their particular disciplines,
	and nothing further, Heidegger calls on us to examine the \enquote{nothing further}
	which by its nature sets the limitations of what can be known about beings. Similar
	to Kant, he is asking us to examine our intuitions in order to found our
	scientific knowledge. Influenced by Edmund Husserl, he takes on a
	phenomenological hermeneutic of our lived experience in order to found our
	intuitions, and thus to examine what gives life meaning, in addition to
	examining the basis for our scientific attitude. The scientific worldview is,
	after all, one among many.

	Heidegger and Carnap are both seated within the Western philosophical tradition,
	and both are attempting to overcome it. Their methods differ quite dramatically,
	however, as do their end goals. Carnap wishes to clear away the cruft of the
	past few millennia in order to see rightly; fundamentally, he believed
	Descartes was on the right track. Heidegger wants to destruct the method and the
	worldview which evolved from Plato through Kant, and especially the scientific
	project began by Descartes. Both do so in order to found a worldview which is capable
	of overcoming the existential conditions which underlie false metaphysical inquiry.
	These conditions, being existential, are immediately tied up in both material
	analysis and practical philosophy, in questions concerning both facts and the meaning
	of life. Nietzsche declared that God is dead, that facts and meaning no longer
	lined up; disenchantment in the early \nth{20} century called for a radical reconstitution
	of the Western worldview, and both authors were determined to find it. In the next
	section we will take a look at how they each went about this destruction.

	\section{Facts and Values}

	% Neokantianism
	Heidegger and Carnap were both educated in the Neokantian tradition. In keeping
	with the post-Kantian idealists, the Neokantians rejected the Kantian
	distinction between the realms of pure sensibility and understanding. Rejecting
	the spatio-temporal form of the pure intuition, the Neokantians preferred a
	pure logical basis for the object of knowledge. \autocite[p28]{friedman2000} This
	tradition was divided between several schools, most notably the Marburg school
	and the Southwest school. While there are many differences between these camps,
	the primary distinction I will focus on is their stance on the distinction
	between logic and values.

	Logic, being a discursive science aimed at proper thinking, is considered to
	be \emph{normative.} For Rickert, a key player of the Southwest school, this leads
	to the claim that logic belongs to the realm of transcendental value. Pure
	logic is then to be distinguished from psychological knowledge, which proceeds
	by empirical means. There is then a gap between \emph{logic} as value, and
	\emph{psychology} as fact \autocite[p34f]{friedman2000}. Rickert and the
	Southwest school are left with a huge problem: how do we deal with the incommensurability
	of facts and values?

	The Marburg school's Cassirer rejects this distinction. Instead of clefting
	the mind between transcendental psychology and pure logic, Cassirer claims that
	these gaps are \emph{moments} of cognition. They are not essential features which
	then are synthesized in to a single cognition, but a unitary relation which
	has been artificially analyzed into parts. Value and fact are analogous to the
	universal and the particular, but for Cassirer this is a difference in matter
	of \emph{viewpoint,} between understanding a thing in its \enquote{thinghood}
	(as it relates to the universal form), and understanding a thing in its \enquote{context}
	(as a being among beings). This separation between viewpoints is \enquote{artificial,}
	only occurring after the initial unitary relation between mind and object
	\autocite[p34f]{friedman2000}.

	% Husserl.
	% TODO: More.
	The parallels between Husserl and the Neokantian schools is fairly clear. Rickert
	writes positively of the \textit{Logical Investigation's}\nocite{husserl2005}
	polemic against psychologism, and there are clear parallels between the unitary
	relation of cognition in Cassirer and Husserl's unitary field of phenomenological
	consciousness (see \textit{Ideas} \S38)\nocite{husserl2012}. Akin to Rickert, Husserl
	ends up proposing transcendental phenomenological ideas.

	For both Carnap and Heidegger, there are a few primary concerns. They both wish
	to flatten the distinction between the real and the ideal; they both proceed
	from phenomenological grounds; and they both do so in a subtle but direct relation
	to their political aims.

	\subsection{Carnap}
	% Carnap

	The scientific worldview lends itself to the notion of a unified science. It is
	Carnap's goal to place science on a unified ground, and in so doing to
	eliminate the confusions which traditional philosophy (\enquote{metaphysics}) has
	perpetuated. The goal of science is to \blockquote[{\citetitle[\S179]{carnap2003}}]{find and order the true statements about the objects of experience}.
	This can be split into two further goals: to create a constructional system
	corresponding to formal logic, and to investigate the nonconstructional relationships
	between objects of experience. We then have two foundational aspects of
	construction theory: conventional stipulation of logical syntax and verification
	through empirical investigation.

	Carnap proceeds from unanalyzable phenomenological units which he calls basic experiences:
	these are whole-field conscious experiences which appear epistemically prior
	to the analysis of their constitutive parts. They are precisely the object of phenomenological
	analysis in Husserl's sense (\citetitle[\S64]{carnap2003}). He proceeds to \enquote{quasi-analyze}
	these experiences by creating a formal allegory and examining the structures
	thereof. His goal is to construct the world through a purely formal analysis of
	basic experience, without any reference to ostensive properties thereof. In order
	to proceed, he needs a foundational relation between experiences, namely recollection
	of similarity.

	In adopting the phenomenological \textit{epoch\'e} and proceeding from purely
	formal analysis, Carnap obviates the distinction between the real and the ideal.
	Ultimately, both \enquote{real} and \enquote{ideal} objects are constructed from
	the same basic experiences. It is important to note that Carnap is not here
	discussing ideals as essences. Quite famously, essences are the stuff of
	metaphysics, which Carnap rejects outright. The difference is that \enquote{ideal}
	objects are purely autopsychological, preceding physical construction, while \enquote{real}
	objects are those that rely on physics and its objectivity \autocite[p77]{friedman2000}.

	The general structure here should sound similar to Cassirer. Both construct the
	objects of experience through formal analysis. However, while Cassirer's construction
	proceeds indefinitely, Carnap constructs definite, finite ranks within the type
	hierarchy of his system \autocite[p80]{friedman2000}.

	For Carnap, as for the Marburg school, all objects are generated through a logical
	(cognitive) faculty through direct experience. \autocite[p75]{friedman2000}. However,
	the difference between what is given (the real) and what is constructed (the ideal)
	is obviated in Carnap. For him, \enquote{a concept and its object are the same.}
	This amounts to a \enquote{functionalization} of the object. Carnap flattens the
	distinction between real and ideal, as both are ultimately constituted objects.
	The real-ideal distinction amounts to the distinction between the spatio-temporal
	order and all others. \autocite[p78]{friedman2000}

	For Carnap, basic experiences do not have any relation to a subject; the \enquote{for-me-ness}
	is analyzed into it after the fact. Similar to how we can only call integers \enquote{integers}
	in contradistinction to the real numbers once we have constructed them, we only
	understand our basic experiences as autopsychological in contrast with the later-constructed
	physical and heteropsychological objects. (\citetitle[{III.C \textit{passim.}}]{carnap2003}).

	\iffalse Carnap takes the neutrality of his constitutional system as something
	of its highlight: it is this neutrality which allows it to become the common basis
	for the three main strands of epistemology: realism, idealism, and
	phenomenalism \autocite[\S178]{carnap2003}. \fi

	% In contrast to the Marburg school, Carnap constructs objects of all kind through
	% definite, finite ranks within the type hierarchy. This is contrasted with Cassirer's
	% infinite regress towards the never-completed \enquote{X} of definite
	% experience. There are only two constitutive components of his constitutional theory:
	% conventional stipulation and empirical experience. (\citetitle[{\S 179}]{carnap2003}),
	% \autocite[p80]{friedman2000}.

	By redefining philosophy as logistics -- within the \textit{Aufbau} as the
	formal logic of the \textit{Principia Mathematica} of Russell and Whitehead,
	and later in the \textit{Syntax} as \emph{any} formal langauge -- Carnap aimed
	to remove the metaphysical notion of the synthetic \textit{a priori.} In doing
	so he would overcome the infinite regress of the Marburg school's object of
	knowledge, thus rooting out the unknowable thing-in-itself. Clearing up these
	final metaphysical notions would leave no room for philosophical
	pseudoproblems which could not be solved by the logical analysis of language.

	% is this necessary context?
	Famously, there is an error in the formation of the physical from the autopsychological.
	In order to ground the physical, we end up needing recourse to the heteropsychological
	to verify our cognition. Since the heteropsychological is itself founded on
	the physical, this is an infinite regress. Carnap's denial of the synthetic
	\textit{a priori} hinges on the definite, finite ranking of all objects, but fails
	to achieve this. Carnap confronts this problem in the \textit{Syntax} by postulating
	two formal languages. Language I constructs definite statements akin to those
	in the classical logics, including the \textit{Aufbau}. Language II constructs
	indefinite statements, those which can proceed to infinity. Physical statements,
	and the statements of classical mathematics generally, are expressible only once
	indefinite structures have been introduced (\citetitle[\S15]{carnap2000}).

	Once we reach the \textit{Syntax,} the stipulatory nature of logic is formalized
	into the principle of tolerance.
	%
	\blockquote[{\citetitle[\S17]{carnap2000}}]{\emph{In logic, there are no morals.} Everyone is at liberty to build up his own logic, i.e. his own form of language, as he wishes. All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods clearly, and give syntactial rules instead of philosophical arguments.}
	%
	Since logic is the ideal evaluative framework, but there are multiple valid logical
	systems, it is up to us to find the ideal logical system to relate to our
	practical aims, whatever they may be. While this provides a minimal modicum of
	guidance, it does not do the crucial thing: there is no standard of ethics. Carnap
	makes clear his non-cognitivist ethics, but leaves us to interpret what this
	entails. There is some evidence that Carnap would be an emotivist. In addition
	to his famous slam on metaphysics as \enquote{bad poetry,} consider the following
	quote: \blockquote[{\citetitle[\S80]{carnap2000}}]{4. According to the ordinary use of language, an action $a$ of a certain person is called a \textit{moral crime} if, in the minds of the majority of other persons, the thought of someone (but not themselves) committing an action of this kind calls forth the feeling of moral indignation.}

	The above quote comes from a discussion on the dangers of the material mode of
	speech. This mode is defined by a casual transposition of complicated
	syntactical statements of the kind discussed in the \textit{Syntax} into ordinary
	speech. The move from discussion of syntax to discussion of material
	properties often leads to shorter and clearer explanations, but easily lends itself
	to confusion. While Carnap claims that this mode of speech is perfectly
	acceptable, and in fact unavoidable, he warns us that this translation leads
	us to speak of spurious universals - i.e., metaphysical essences. Additionally,
	some material sentences simply cannot be translated into formal syntax. Although
	these statements are useful for expressing ourselves, they cannot be subject
	to claims about truth and falsity, and so have no place in a scientific philosophy.

	\blockquote[{\citetitle[\S81]{carnap2000}}]{If a sentence of the material mode of speech is given \dots, then the translation into the formal mode of speech \dots must always be possible. \emph{Translatability into the formal mode of speech constitutes the touchstone for all philosophical sentences}, or more generally, for all sentences which do not belong to the language of any one of the empirical sciences. \dots Sentences which do not give even a slight indication to determine their translation are outside the realm of the language of science and therefore incapable of discussion, no matter what depths or heights of feeling they may stir. }

	In a rare direct confrontation, Carnap claims in a 1932 lecture series that ethical
	statements are in essence prescriptive: they are imperative statements. However,
	the material mode of speech allows us to slip up and propose spurious ethical
	essences. \enquote{Do not kill,} for example, is clearly an imperative, while
	\enquote{killing is evil} is an assertion about a universal property. Carnap's
	metaethics is not then a simple emotivism, but a prescriptivism \autocite[1.4]{carnap1996}.

	So Carnap's scientific conviction leads him to propose a non-cognitivist ethics.
	Any justification for normative ethics must be made within the language of
	science, but the objects of its study are a matter of \emph{psychology} and
	not something which can be derived from universal principles of reason. Any ethical
	claim must take the shape of formal-logical arguments proceeding from psychological
	principles of emotion, ultimately amounting to an arbitrary (set?) of formal languages
	which capture the ethical feelings we experience as part of our basic experience.
	In all cases, logic comes first, and the emotions come second.

	\subsection{Heidegger}

	Heidegger famously places emotions at the heart of his phenomenological analysis
	of Dasein. In \textit{Being and Time,} the method of analysis is laid out as a
	hermeneutic of lived experience. This is done in an attempt to directly
	cognize the essence of Being, that is, the

	% There is a huge difference between Heidegger and Carnap in their relation to time.
	% Carnap wants a timeless approach to consciousness. Heidegger believes this to be
	% impossible: all truth is essentially historical, relative to Dasein as it is in
	% a particular historical moment. (Need a citation.)

	% Heidegger vs Carnap on phenomenonology
	% TODO SOMEWHERE: Heidegger's critique of Descartes applies to Carnap.

	Hiedeger's conception of phemonenon hinges on his udnerstanding of apophantic logos,
	that is, the discursive basis for analysis and truth-bearing in general.
	Logois is a letting-something-be-seen; thus it can be true or false. Truth in
	Heidegger's sense relates more closely to \blockquote[{\cite[p57]{heidegger2008b}}]{the sheer sensory perception of something.}
	Connection to dialectical theology; at least parallels. Logic then operates on
	their basic phenomenal experiences; phenomnoelogy then is the analysis of basic
	experienes. But the phneomnon is unalayzable in the sense that it has no
	constituitive parts; there is nothing \enquote{Behind} the phenomenon to be
	uncovered \autocite[p60]{heidegger2008b}. But what Heidegger takes to be the object
	of phenomenology is closer to the Husserlian idea; his conception of Being is
	very close to it. (In what respects?)

	The phenomenon is distinguished from the appearnce; the appearnce is
	manifestly what it is note; it hides its true nature , the Being of the phneomon
	from which it originates. Note that Being is at root \emph{historical,} and so
	it can be covered up or revealed at certain points of time.

	The phenomnoelogical method by which Hiedegger aims to disclose the meaning of
	Being in general takes on the form of a hermeneutic analysis of the existnetial
	character of Dasein, the being whose Being is a matter of concern to it.

	Heidegger and CArnap agree that fundmental phenomenon are unaalyzable, but waht
	they consider phenonon to be are quite distinct. Carnap takes what Heidegger
	would call the \enquote{oridnary} conception of phenemon, akin to Kant
	\autocite[p54]{heidegger2008b}. What Heidegger wishes to call phenomenon are closer
	to the formas of the intuition. Kant analyzes phenomena as occuring in space
	and time. By analogy, Heiddger extends this to be the necessary underlying
	charactstict Being of any being, irrespective of the empirical character. His
	goal is to move away from the scientific conception toward a more fundamental
	analysis.

	Phenomenology cannot proceed in the form of logicla assertions because this
	separates the essential character of the Being from its context. \enquote{It gets understood in an empty way}
	and \enquote{loses its indigenous character} \autocite[p61.]{heidegger2008b}
	So \emph{logos} cannot be \emph{logistics.}

	The dialectical characteristic of logos presupposes the being-with-others of Dasein,
	its relation to \emph{das Man.} All of the essential characteristics of Dasein's
	Being seem to occur simulatneously; they characterize it rather than appear to
	it. What is Heidegger's epistemology?

	Heidegger's criticism of the scientific attitude can be most clearly seen in his
	criticism of Descartes \autocite[{I.3 B, especially \P21}]{heidegger2008b}.
	Here he talks fairly explicitly about values.

	Carnap actually would agree with Heidegger that Descartes' project is insufficient,
	but his critique would be quite different. Instead of offering an analysis of different
	\enquote{modes of being} as a criticism of the Cartesian worldview, he would offer
	the gestalt-theoretical experience as having nothing to do with an ego. This
	has to be constructed from the aspects of the experience; \textit{res extensa}
	is not the most fundamental

	--

	Heidegger prefers a holistic approach. The analytic of Dasein occurs piecemeal,
	but each piece influences and is influenced by the whole. Carnap prefers a
	constructivist approach, where the basic units of experience are assumed, and
	the rest is built from there.

	% to this, Heidegger and Carnap both reject the primacy of the mental,
	% preferring instead to proceed from the material to the essential. It is useful
	% for us to see how Carnap and Heidegger differ in the critiques of Husserl.

	% Stone argues that Heidegger and Carnap both wished to save ethics by limiting the
	% pretensions of metaphysics. For both, this manifest itself in political action.
	% However, both authors operate off of a kind of \enquote{faith} - a faith in
	% the future of humanity which they as of yet cannot see or determine. This faith
	% is Nietzschean in nature - for Heidegger this is quite explicit, given his
	% famous lectures. For Carnap this faith is less obvious. \autocite{sachs2011}

	% In the scientific world-conception, we proceed from our senses to make general
	% claims about the world through logical analysis. Essence is rejected; only what
	% can be verified empirically is accepted as real. Metaphysics, as purely intellectual,
	% is rejected as an unnatural attitude toward the world. As Heidegger saw, and
	% as many critics of the Vienna Circle have pointed out, this rejection of the metaphysical
	% does no good to explain why the scientific world-conception should itself be accepted;
	% it is a metaphysical claim without justification. A positivist might respond that
	% there \emph{could} be no verifiable justification; while we are free to debate
	% how we ought to live, this goes beyond the scope of knowledge, and to claim otherwise
	% is empty pretension. Heidegger, on the other hand, does not proceed from the
	% strict demarcations of science, but rather finds his existential subject among
	% other subjects in the world; it is the subject's existence among other
	% subjects which imbues it with meaning, and which allows for it to relate to the
	% world in various ways. Without this being-in-the-world, being-among-others,
	% and being-towards-death, there is no metaphysics (for Heidegger, fundamental ontology);
	% and without metaphysics, there is no justification for science.

	% I will define the concepts of object, science, language, and logic as both thinker
	% see it. We will need these definitions to work out just what they mean when
	% they speak of metaphysics.

	% Heidegger and Carnap share the same conception of an object. In Carnap:
	% \blockquote[{\cite[5]{carnap2003}}]{The word \enquote{object} is here always used in its widest sense, namely, for anything about which a statement can be made.

	\section{Metaphysics - How to Found the Sciences?}

	For Heidegger, \enquote{metaphysics} is characterized by a misuse of language,
	that is, it is the linguistic fallacy of speaking of Being as \emph{a} being. Where
	we need to speak of the characteristic essence of beings as a whole, we are
	instead speaking of essential beings. For Carnap, it's quite similar. Metaphysics
	is the misuse of language to speak of things which cannot be structurally analyzed,
	that is, properly thought.

	Carnap characterizes Heidegger's misuse of language in \enquote{The Elimination}
	as an attempt to substantiate something which cannot be substantiated. That is,
	Heidegger attempts to speak of \enquote{the Nothing} as if it is in fact a something,
	a substantial thing. However, this clearly is nonsense under the guise of
	first-order predicate logic. There is no way to adequately capture \enquote{the Nothing nothings}
	with the existential quantifier. Carnap outlines a transition from ordinary language
	to formal language. He characterizes the transition first by creating an
	object, which we call \enquote{nothing} ($no$). We then construct various predicates
	about \enquote{the nothing} by instantiating them with the pseudo-object. However,
	Carnap argues that what we mean by \enquote{nothing} cannot be instantiated,
	as it is represented by a quantifier ($\neg\exists x.Px$ for some property $P$).
	So he argues that we ought to dismiss Heidegger's talk as nonsense.

	It is fairly apparent to anyone with an understanding of higher-level logics that,
	in fact, we \emph{can} predicate over quantifiers. We could write \enquote{the Nothing nothings}
	as something like the following: $N(\neg\exists x . Px)$, and then express
	properties of this nothing-ing predicate as appropriate. So even on his own terms,
	given the advances in logic since the article was written, Carnap's argument fails.
	He acknowledges as much in later writings (SOURCE), but still maintains that his
	interpretation of Heidegger is correct. How does he claim this?

	Even if we are to predicate over nothing, this form is highly unwieldy, and
	does little to explain exactly what Heidegger is trying to do by
	substantiating nothing.

	\section{Putting the Question Correctly}

	Carnap and Heidegger both emphasized the importance of language to our understanding
	of the world. While Heidegger explicitly used poetic language to speak about
	what lies beyond science, Carnap believed that that which science cannot formalize
	should explicitly be avoided in philosophical discourse. Any extrascientific
	influence is akin to metaphysics: it cannot be formalized, and so should be
	avoided. In fact, it can be actively dangerous. Carnap worried that metaphysical
	language, though its claims are unverifiable, could have \blockquote[]{psychological impacts}
	which could influence by an appeal to authority rather than to reason. This was
	not without good cause: Gogarten and Heidegger would both endorse the Nazi
	party. \autocite{dambock2022}

	The logical positivists preferred to analyze the logical structure of scientific
	language over material analysis. This is directly reflected in the title of
	Carnap's first major work, \textit{The Logical Structure of the World} \nocite{carnap2003}.\footnote{I
	will refer to this book as the \textit{Aufbau}.} In this book he would proceed
	from the atomic structures of our reason to construct an entire empirical worldview
	supposedly capable of recreating the world of science. His aim is to show the
	unified basis of all the sciences, that is, to show that there is only one
	proper science, and that the separation of the sciences into epistemologically
	and ontologically distinct subfields is a mistake. In line with the rest of
	the circle, this was to be done through conceptual reduction and reconstruction.
	At the time of writing, Carnap's focus was to create a single constructional system
	which would underlie the sciences. As his work matured, and by the time of his
	later major work, \textit{The Logical Syntax of Language} \nocite{carnap2000},
	he would shift his view to accommodate flexibility in the choice of the formal
	system. He calls this the principle of tolerance. \blockquote[{\citetitle[{\S 17}]{carnap2000}}]{Everyone is at liberty to build up his own logic, i.e. his own form of language, as he wishes. All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods clearly, and give syntactical rules instead of philosophical arguments.}
	Nonetheless, the method of logical reduction and the autopsychological basis
	of scientific theory holds. This basis is directly related to Husserl's through
	the use of the \textit{epoche}, or the bracketing of psychological experiences
	as real or unreal (see \citetitle[{\S 64}]{carnap2003}). Instead of proposing
	a realm of abstract entities alongside the conceptual connections between them,
	Carnap would propose only the logical structure, with the objects of that
	structure taken to be entirely arbitrary.

	Carnap and his circle's strict adherence to their scientific aims, and their rejection
	of metaphysics, is directly influenced by their political goals. Carnap writes
	in the preface to the \textit{Aufbau},
	%
	\blockquote[{\cite[xvii-xviii]{carnap2003}}]{our confidence ... stems from ... the belief that [metaphysics and theology] belong to the past. We feel that there is an inner kinship between the attitude on which our philosophical work is founded and the intellectual attitude which presently manifests in entirely different walks of life. ... It is an orientation which demands clarity everywhere, but which realizes that the fabric of life can never quite be comprehended. ... Our work is carried by the faith that this attitude will win the future.}
	%
	The work of the \textit{Aufbau} and the rest of his corpus can only be
	explained by a pragmatic choice, the choice to pursue the method which has so far
	given us the most progress in science, and which promises, according to the value
	theory held by the group, to provide the most equitable and prosperous
	conditions for mankind. His justification for the scientific worldview thus appeals
	to the political and social aims of the leftist movements of the \nth{20}
	century.

	\section{Conclusion}

	Carnap and Hiedegger come to opposite conclusions from the same background.
	Both wish to confront the incommensurability of facts and meaning. Carnap does
	so by expunging meaning from scientific discourse, leaving it to the poets to
	sort out. For Carnap, scientific discourse is central. Logic ought to guide us
	more than the irrational whims of desire; it is left to the poets to express
	these \enquote{attitudes toward life.} Although both agree that the sciences are
	preceeded by the emotions, and that in life we are always already experiencing
	some attitude toward the world, they disagree about what this means for human life.
	Heidegger takes the ontical primacy of the emotions as evidence of their
	philosophical priority. If we are to orient ourselves to the world in a meaningful
	manner, we must think through our moods and our emotions; rather than viewing them
	as a useful but irrational orientatating schema, we ought to consider them as
	precisely indicative of a relation to the world. Only through an analysis of this
	sort can we come to understand how we ought to relate to the world. However, the
	primacy of emotive, orienting rationality is not to deny the categorical
	rationality of logic. The difference in our author's positions becomes clear in
	their stances towards language. For Carnap, formal syntax is the proper mode of
	scientific communication, and thus the only way to properly enunciate an idea
	(where by \enquote{idea} we mean the formal, Kantian notion of an idea: that
	of an empirical statement about the world). %This is incorrect.

	Political and geospatial differences fuelled the distance that Carnap and
	Heidegger felt from each other, despite working from similar grounds. If we
	are able to overcome these differences to see the throughline, perhaps we could
	reinvigorate a more linguistic turn in analytic value theory. % Sellars.
