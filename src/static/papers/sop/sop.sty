I want to undertake the work of revealing unspoken assumptions and hidden labor,
and of challenging hegemonic beliefs about the creation and dissemination of knowledge
and wisdom. I want to investigate disparate philosophical traditions and
practices. This is a wide-reaching enterprise, and it requires a wide-reaching
study. By applying at \schoolname{}, I hope to take advantage of your course offerings
and specialties in \specialities{} to further this goal.

I am primarily interested in phenomenology, comparative philosophy, philosophy
of mind, and aesthetics. I am also interested in semiotics, semantics, critical
theory, and value theory more generally. My interests converge in the study of
embodied consciousness with influence from Buddhist conceptions of mind, and through
the practice of interactive art.

I have spent several years out of graduate school, and currently work as a
software engineer. This career was made possible by my time in undergraduate spent studying mathematics
(my other major), logic, computer science, and the philosophy of mathematics. In
my senior year I took an independent study which focused on mathematical Platonism
and the foundations of mathematics. At the same time, I wrote my senior thesis on
the Heidegger-Carnap debate and earned my degree a semester early and with honors.
Additionally, I won the Paretsky Award for Creativity, a university-wide
competition, for a paper applying the early Heidegger's phenomenological method to
the absent qualia problem. In my Junior year I was awarded the departmental
Warner Morse Scholarship for excellence in philosophy.

I have a developed interest in Buddhist and Indian philosophy. I find Theravada and
Zen Buddhism especially insightful, and I am particularly interested in learning
more about the Kyoto School for their emphasis on nihility and the limits of
rational thought.

I find phenomenology is a good tool for the exploration of aesthetics and value
theory quite generally. To this end I am interested in the work of Merleau-Ponty,
Levinas, and critical theory. In aesthetics I have been especially focused on
the developing field of ludology. I am interested in understanding whether
and how alternative media are capable of 'doing' philosophy. Interactive media, as 'lived in' experiences,
seem to hold a special potential in this regard.

I hope to spend my time doing a close study of the phenomenological method as a
foundation of philosophical and scientific theory. In addition to the traditional
forms of essay-writing and pedagogy, I hope to explore alternative media as a
form of philosophical expression.
